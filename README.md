<h2>Platforms</h2>
<h3><a href="https://codingame.com/">CodinGame</a></h3>
<p>CodinGame has a section with a lot of coding exercises to solve, it has four categories, easy, medium, hard and very hard. You can solve any of those exercises with any language you would like, that's why I've made some of them in JavaScript, Python, Dart and C++.</p>

<h3><a href="https://freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://jutge.org/">Jutge</a></h3>
<p>This is a platform that my university uses for exercises and exams, it's not the best but has tons of exercises to practice. To access any of them you have to enter the base URL + problems + problem id, for example, <a href="https://jutge.org/problems/P81602">https://jutge.org/problems/P81602</a>. Some of the exercises are only in Catalan and some others aren't even public, unfortunately, most of them are only available in C++.</p>

<h3><a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://sololearn.com/">Sololearn</a></h3>
<p>This is the platform I used to start learning to code, it's great but it doesn't have many exercises, at least not many that are free. All the solutions I've made for them were when I was starting so they're probably not great but I still have them as a reminder.</p>
